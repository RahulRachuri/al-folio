* I am pursuing a PhD in the [Crypto Group](https://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/) at [Aarhus University, Denmark](https://international.au.dk/) under [Prof. Peter Scholl](https://pascholl.github.io/) and [Prof. Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/). My research is mainly focused on building efficient protocols for Secure Multiparty Computation. More specifically, my work is geared towards the domain of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, as well as providing efficient implementations for them.

* I received my iMTech (BTech + MTech) degree in Information Technology from [International Insitute of Information Technology, Bangalore](iiitb.ac.in/) in 2019. As a part of my thesis, I built an efficient framework to perform Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning using Secure Multiparty Computation. I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Ashish Choudhury](https://sites.google.com/site/ashishcrypto/), along with members of the [CrIS Lab](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/).
